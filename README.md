# PayPal Agent Toolkit

The PayPal Agent Toolkit enables popular agent frameworks including OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, Vercel's AI SDK, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate with PayPal APIs through function calling. It includes support for TypeScript and is built on top of PayPal APIs and the PayPal [Node][node-sdk] SDKs.

## TypeScript

### Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package run:

```
npm install @paypal/agent-toolkit
```

#### Requirements

- Node 18+

### Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's client id and secret which is available in your [PayPal Developer Dashboard][api-keys]. 

```typescript
import {PayPalAgentToolkit} from '@paypal/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk';
const paypalToolkit = new PayPalAgentToolkit({
     clientId: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
     clientSecret: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
});

const llm: LanguageModelV1 = getModel(); // The model to be used with ai-sdk
const {text: response}= await generateText({
    model: llm,
    tools: await paypalToolkit.getTools(),
    prompt: `Create an invoice for 3 hours of labor at $120/hr and text a link to John Doe.`,
});

```

#### Tools

The toolkit works with LangChain and Vercel's AI SDK and can be passed as a list of tools. For example:

```typescript
import { AgentExecutor, createStructuredChatAgent } from "langchain/agents";

const tools = payPalAgentToolkit.getTools();

const agent = await createStructuredChatAgent({
  llm,
  tools,
  prompt,
});

const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
  agent,
  tools,
});
```

## PayPal Model Context Protocol

The PayPal [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/) server allows you to integrate with PayPal APIs through function calling. This protocol supports various tools to interact with different PayPal services.

To run the PayPal MCP server using npx, use the following command:

```bash
# Start MCP Inspector and server with all tools
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js --tools=all --access-token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN --paypal-environment=SANDBOX
```

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your PayPal client credentials available in your [PayPal Developer Dashboard][api-keys]. Alternatively, you could set the PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in your environment variables.

Alternatively, you can set up your own MCP server. For example:

```typescript
import { PayPalAgentToolkit } from â€œ@paypal/agent-toolkit/modelcontextprotocol";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const tools = payPalAgentToolkit.getTools();

const server = new PayPalAgentToolkit({
	clientId: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
	clientSecret: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
});

async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
  console.error("PayPal MCP Server running on stdio");
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop (Similar steps for Cline/Cursor/Github Co-Pilot, etc.)

This guide explains how to integrate the PayPal connector with Claude Desktop.

## Prerequisites
- Claude Desktop application installed
- Administrator access to your computer (for installing Node.js)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Node.js

Node.js is required for the PayPal connector to function:

1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   Both commands should display version numbers if installation was successful.

### 2. Configure PayPal Connector in Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Find the Developer or Advanced settings section
4. Locate the external tools or connectors configuration area
5. Add the following PayPal connector configuration:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
     "paypal": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": [
         "-y",
         "@paypal/agent-toolkit",
         "--tools=all"
       ],
       "env": {
         "PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
         "PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT": "SANDBOX"
       }
     }
   }
}
```
Make sure to replace `YOUR_PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual PayPal Access Token. Alternatively, you could set the PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN as an environment variable. You can also pass it as an argument using --access-token in "args"
Set `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT` value as either `SANDBOX` for stage testing and `PRODUCTION` for production environment.

6. Save your configuration changes

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Quit and restart Claude Desktop to apply changes
2. Test the connection by asking Claude to perform a PayPal-related task
   - Example: \"List my PayPal invoices\"

## Available tools

| Tool                       | Description                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `invoices.create`          | Create a new invoice              |
| `invoices.list`            | List invoices                     |
| `invoices.send`            | Send an invoice to recipients     |
| `invoices.sendReminder`    | Send a reminder for an invoice    |
| `invoices.cancel`          | Cancel a sent invoice             |


## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used:

- `PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your PayPal Access Token
- `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to `SANDBOX` for sandbox mode, `PRODUCTION` for production (defaults to `SANDBOX` mode)


This guide explains how to generate an access token for PayPal API integration, including how to find your client ID and client secret.



## Prerequisites

- PayPal Developer account (for Sandbox)
- PayPal Business account (for production)

## Finding Your Client ID and Client Secret

1. **Create a PayPal Developer Account**:
   - Go to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/)
   - Sign up or log in with your PayPal credentials

2. **Access Your Credentials**:
   - In the Developer Dashboard, click on **Apps & Credentials** in the menu
   - Switch between **Sandbox** and **Live** modes depending on your needs
   
3. **Create or View an App**:
   - To create a new app, click **Create App**
   - Give your app a name and select a Business account to associate with it
   - For existing apps, click on the app name to view details

4. **Retrieve Credentials**:
   - Once your app is created or selected, you'll see a screen with your:
     - **Client ID**: A public identifier for your app
     - **Client Secret**: A private key (shown after clicking \"Show\")
   - Save these credentials securely as they are required for generating access tokens

## Generating an Access Token
### Using cURL

```bash
curl -v https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \\
  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\
  -H \"Accept-Language: en_US\" \\
  -u \"CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET\" \\
  -d \"grant_type=client_credentials\"
```

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with your actual credentials. For production, use `https://api-m.paypal.com` instead of the sandbox URL.


### Using Postman

1. Create a new request to `https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token`
2. Set method to **POST**
3. Under **Authorization**, select **Basic Auth** and enter your Client ID and Client Secret
4. Under **Body**, select **x-www-form-urlencoded** and add a key `grant_type` with value `client_credentials`
5. Send the request

### Response

A successful response will look like:

```json
{
  "scope": "...",
  "access_token": "Your Access Token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "app_id": "APP-80W284485P519543T",
  "expires_in": 32400,
  "nonce": "..."
}
```

Copy the `access_token` value for use in your Claude Desktop integration.

## Token Details

- **Sandbox Tokens**: Valid for 3-8 hours
- **Production Tokens**: Valid for 8 hours
- It's recommended to implement token refresh logic before expiration

## Using the Token with Claude Desktop

Once you have your access token, update the `PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` value in your Claude Desktop connector configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT": "SANDBOX"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Store client ID and client secret securely
2. Implement token refresh logic to handle token expiration
3. Use environment-specific tokens (sandbox for testing, production for real transactions)
4. Avoid hardcoding tokens in application code
